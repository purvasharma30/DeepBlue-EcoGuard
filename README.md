<h1 align="center" id="title">DeepBlue EcoGuard</h1>


<p id="description">DeepBlue EcoGuard tackles the rising issue of underwater waste with three key solutions: a YoloV8 Algorithm for precise waste detection, a rule-based classifier for assessing aquatic habitat, and a Machine Learning model to classify water quality. The YoloV8 Algorithm, trained on 5000 images, detects waste, while the rule-based classifier uses guidelines from the US EPA and WHO for habitat assessment. The Machine Learning model, trained on a dataset of over 6 million rows, reliably classifies water as fit or unfit. This project offers a comprehensive approach to safeguard our oceans and marine life.</p>

## Suitable Process Model: Incremental Model

**Reasoning:**

- **Iterative Development:** The Incremental Model allows for iterative development, which aligns well with the project's complex nature. The development of underwater waste detection, habitat assessment, and water quality classification modules can be tackled incrementally.

- **Progressive Building of Functionality:** Each increment in the Incremental Model adds new functionality to the system. This aligns with the DeepBlue EcoGuard project, where distinct functionalities, such as waste detection, habitat assessment, and water quality classification, can be developed and integrated incrementally.

- **Early Delivery of Partial System:** The Incremental Model facilitates the early delivery of a partial system with each increment. This is beneficial for the DeepBlue EcoGuard project, as it allows stakeholders to start using and benefiting from certain functionalities while others are still under development.

- **Feedback Mechanism:** The model incorporates a feedback mechanism after each increment, allowing for continuous improvement based on user feedback and changing requirements. This is crucial for a project like DeepBlue EcoGuard, where real-world conditions and user interactions may necessitate adjustments and enhancements.

- **Risk Mitigation:** Incremental development helps in mitigating risks by allowing for the identification and resolution of issues early in the development process. Given the complexity of the project and the integration of various algorithms, this iterative approach reduces the likelihood of major setbacks.
